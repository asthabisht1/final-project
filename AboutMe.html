            <h3>Research Experience</h3>
            <p>I currently work as an undergraduate research assistant at the Perry Lab at UCSD where we study the distinct retina patterns across different insect species in attempts to understand the genetic coding behind behind the formation of insect retiina. Other relevant research experiences include internships at the Lundquist Institute and City of Hope. I also have experience reviewing scientific literature and writing research papers, two of which are attached below. </p>

            <h3>Relevant Experience</h3>
            <p>Apart from research experience, other extracurriculars and involvements include serving as Sixth College's Coboard Co-Chair where I plan events and activities meant to bring the Sixth College community together. I also shadow a radiologist at UCSD School of Medicine and serve as a volunteer at a local food bank. My coursework including introductory biology lab, general chemistry + lab, genetics, and organic chemistry have allowed me to study the sciences more deeply and I have been able to fine-tune my laboratory skills.</p>
